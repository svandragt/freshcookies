# Fresh Cookies
Did you know many websites store information on your device for years? Cookies can contain unique identifiers, which can link you up to previous visits. But clearing out all your cookies is a pain, and managing them can be time intensive.

Fresh Cookies limits the maximum age of new web cookies for your privacy benefit.

(This addon is marked experimental as I'm looking for your feedback on how this works for you)

The default is 15 days, but you can change this to between 1 and 30 days.
